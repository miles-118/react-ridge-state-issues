- See Error

```
ReferenceError: exports is not defined in ES module scope This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '../react-ridge-state-issues/node_modules/react-ridge-state/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
```

## Tests

- Adding `["@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"],` to `apps/next/.babelrc.json` changes the error to `ESM packages (react-ridge-state) need to be imported. Use 'import' to reference the package instead. https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/import-esm-externals`
